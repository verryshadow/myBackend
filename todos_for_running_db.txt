Connect to the server: psql postgresql://codex-postgres:codex-password@localhost:5432/codex_ui


Maybe important commands in the sql terminal:
- listing all tables: /dt
- list view: \dv
- exit: \q

Queries:
- Insert new Site (this needs to be done before it is possible to query it): INSERT INTO site VALUES (1, 'site1');
